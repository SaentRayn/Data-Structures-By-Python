### Combination Example:

> Instructions: Use the Conjunction file to begin a python server that will load in the html file. This can be accomplished through cloning of the whole directory or simply cloning the server.py and index.html files to a common directory or folder. Once the server is run it can be opened at localhost.com/8080. If the site prompts a list of files or folders, then the user must navigate to the folder containing the index.html. For the repo it might be as simple as clicking the conjunction hyperlink.
